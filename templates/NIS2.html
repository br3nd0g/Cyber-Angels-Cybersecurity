        <h1>The NIS2 Directive</h1>
        <p>The NIS2 directive is an upcoming EU regulation which underscores the critical importance of cybersecurity across European sectors, with specific emphasis on network and information systems. This directive expands the scope of organisations falling under the previous NIS directive’s regulations, while also making the board of directors directly liable. The responsibility of preventing and responding to any breaches, leaks or other attacks will fall on these boards. Given this significant responsibility, it is imperative for boards to thoroughly inform themselves about NIS2 law and its implications. By understanding and adhering to cybersecurity standards outlined in the directive, boards can effectively protect their organizations from cyber threats. For more detailed information, see the following website from the rijksoverheid <a href="https://www.ncsc.nl/over-ncsc/wettelijke-taak/wat-gaat-de-nis2-richtlijn-betekenen-voor-uw-organisatie/samenvatting-nis2-richtlijn#:~:text=De%20NIS2%2Drichtlijn%20richt%20zich,cybersecurity%20bij%20bedrijven%20en%20organisaties." target=”_blank”>here</a>.<br><br>Due to this directive, boards are imperatively required to increase their knowledge, measures and actions against cyber threats. This website can assist in doing so, with a page to learn over critical cyber threats in healthcare, the risks and measures, as well as pages to test your knowledge and reactions to scenarios, and lastly a checklist page, for tracking measures taken.</p>
